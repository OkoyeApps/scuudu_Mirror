                        suspicious movement. It is a fraud detection and prevention system that makes use of artificial
                        Intelligence and Machine Learning to flag irregular transactions.<br /> <br />The system is of utmost need
                        given the continuous rise in financial and wire frauds in Nigeria and beyond. WyreWolf is built
                        to become every userâ€™s security alert. Annually, Nigerian banks and individuals loose over N15
                        billion to frauds related to unauthorized withdrawals from ATM and Bank Apps. This is a big
                        challenge and there is no comprehensive solution available yet to address this issue.
